# MEGA MAN DODGE!
megaman.py is Randy's very ghetto game.

wander.py is my learning experiment.

## current development
1. wander.py: megaman is under various experiments.

## Prerequisite
1.  Python 2.7 (sorry pyglet isn't fully functioning under python 3). To figure out where your python 2 is installed, run `where python`
2.  virtualenv
3.  pip
4.  'pip freeze' gives

cwcutils==0.1.1

pyglet==1.2.4

wheel==0.24.0


## Installation
1.  Create a virtualenv for the game using python 2.7.
1.1  run `virtualenv --python $(which python2) MYGAME`
2.  Run `pip install pyglet cwcutils`
3.  Run `python wander.py`
4.  Enjoy the game!

## How to play
1.  Use key: left, right, up, and down to control Mega Man
2.  Hit ESC to exit the game
